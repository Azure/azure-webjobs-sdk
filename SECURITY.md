# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) through https://msrc.microsoft.com or by emailing secure@microsoft.com. 
You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your 
original message. Further information, including the MSRC PGP key, can be found in the [MSRC Report an Issue FAQ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/faqs-report-an-issue).

Please do not open issues for anything you think might have a security implication.
